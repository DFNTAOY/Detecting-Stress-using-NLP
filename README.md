DETECTING STRESS LEVERAGING THE POWER OF NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)

This project leverage the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP), in order to be able to analyze user's comments and be able to draw a closer conclusion on whether the said user is going through a stressful moment or a stress-free invididual.

Ofcourse, the model is not too accurate, there are times where wrong prediction were suggested by the model and this could simply be due to the need for more data for the model to train on and the as well as fine-tuning the Data Preprocessing stages, such as: 

* Using better tokenizer
* Imploring more Stopwords dictionaries
* Using improved Stemming function

To say the least, and ofocurse more improved Binary Classification Machine learning model can be used in future Model performance enhamcement.

All the needed libraries have been imported and user can feel free to test out this model.

Thank you for reading thus far.
